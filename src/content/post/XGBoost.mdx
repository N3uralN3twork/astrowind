# Abstract

This project will focus on the famous XGBoost system and its application
on a moderately large dataset. Starting with a history of the system,
then exploring the algorithm itself, and finally ending with an
application to forest cover types, this project will hopefully provide a
framework on which to base further research and applications.

# Introduction

Tree-based methods are popular due to their superior performance on
tabular data. They work by repeatedly dividing the predictor space into
regions in order to make predictions for both classification and
regression problems. The most basic type of tree is the decision tree.
The decision tree is simple to implement and to interpret. However, it
usually doesn’t perform as well as other supervised methods in terms of
accuracy. Bagging, boosting, and ensembling are all ways to improve the
performance of decision trees.Boosting is a method of iteratively
improving a model. One benefit of boosting is that both the bias and
variance of the model is controlled, as opposed to just one. There are
several popular algorithms for boosting: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting,
XGBoost, and others. One of the issues with most boosting algorithms is
the computation time, which is why the XGBoost algorithm has gained so
much traction over recent years.From Tianqi Chen and Carlos Guestrin in
March of 2014, XGBoost has been a monumental system in the field of
advanced analytics and machine learning. XGBoost was initially a
research project started by Tianqi Chen - and later Carlos Guestrin - at
the University of Washington, who presented their paper at SIGKDD
Conference in 2016. Since then, version 1.5.0 is available for public
usage and has been implemented in more than 5 languages including: C++,
Python, R, Java, Scala, and Julia. In addition, the system is available
to all modern operating systems, including: Windows, OS X, Linux, and a
variety of cloud platforms.

# **Background**

## **Decision Trees**

Decision Trees are simple clustering algorithms that split the predictor
space into distinct, non-overlapping regions.Trees are easy to
visualize, are flexible since they make no assumption about the
functional form, and can model highly non-linear relationships.They can
also be used in the context of regression and classification.

Generally speaking, the algorithm works by searching through the
available predictors and selecting the one that splits the leads to the
greatest reduction in residual sums of squares (RSS), called recursive
binary splitting.However, the model does not look beyond a single split
to see if other predictors may lead to a greater overall reduction of
RSS over the course of many splits.This is called a greedy algorithm.
Considering the image below, we see that decision trees are a top-down
approach, meaning that they start with the full predictor space then,
moving down, create rules that split the space into distinct regions.
The end result is a set divided predictor space of non-overlapping
regions, as seen on the left. The splitting process continues until a
criterion is met, whether it be a defined maximal depth, number of
observations per leaf, or number of observations per split.

Tree pruning is a method that can improve the predictive accuracy of
decision trees. Pruning refers to the reduction in depth of the tree.
One concern about decision trees is over-fitting by modeling noise or
being too complex. Utilizing a process known as cost complexity pruning,
the optimal tree depth may be determined.This process considers the
prediction error and the number of terminal nodes, as illustrated in the
equation below.Cost complexity pruning aims to minimize this equation.
The tuning parameter, *α*, controls the complexity, or depth, of the
tree. A large *α* will result in a deep, complex tree (less pruning) and
a small will result in a shallow tree (more pruning). In general,
shallow trees cannot model all of the patterns in the data and will have
higher prediction error at the cost of low complexity.Deep trees can
model the patterns in the data at the cost of high complexity and
potential over-fitting.There exists a happy medium between the two.

Classification requires small modifications to the fitting process
compared to regression. Notably, instead of considering RSS,
classification trees may consider either classification error, entropy,
or the Gini Index.When the goal of modelling is prediction accuracy, it
is generally advisable to minimize classification error for the splits.
Classification error looks at the proportion of observations in each
region belonging to a certain class and compares this to the most common
classification of observations in that region. The equation below is
used to calculate the classification error given region *m* and class
*k*.
$CE = 1 − max(\hat{p}_{mk})$

Entropy and the Gini Index are most commonly used for classification and
are very similar in that they consider node purity. Node purity refers
to the assortment of observations in a node. If all of the observations
in a node have the same class label, then it is said to have high
purity. If there are many different observation classes in a node, then
it is not pure.High node purity is generally preferred. The equations
for entropy and Gini Index are below.Just as regression trees aim to
minimize RSS, classification trees aim to minimize entropy and Gini.

$$
\Large G = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{mk} * (1 - \hat{p}_{mk})
$$

$$
\Large E = - \sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{p}_{mk} * log(\hat{p}_{mk})
$$

Decision trees can be advantageous since they are easy to interpret and
can model a variety of data types. However, they have some weaknesses. A
primary weakness is that they can have a high degree of variance.Another
weakness is that they are not robust in the sense that the
addition/removal of a single observation may result in a very different
tree shape.There are several ways to handle these concerns, commonly
bagging, random forests, and boosting. We will discuss boosting, in
particular.

## Boosting

Boosting is a general ensemble algorithm that can be used to improve the
predictive accuracy of decision trees. Boosting assumes a generic
function then fits a shallow tree of the residuals. After incorporating
the new tree to get an updated function, another shallow tree is fit to
the updated function’s residuals.This process repeats until a criterion
is met. Just like decision trees, the final resulting model is a single
tree.

The boosting algorithm has three main steps:

1.  Define an initial model to be fit to the data.

2.  Iteratively fit B-many shallow trees to the residuals of the
    previous model and add them to the previous model

    1.  Fit a tree with d-many splits to the prior model’s residuals

    2.  Update the previous model by adding a shrunken version of the
        shallow tree.

    3.  Update the residuals by subtracting the shrunken version of the
        shallow tree

3.  After B-many shallow trees have been fit to the residuals, the
    result is a single boosted model.

From the algorithm, we can see that the boosted model is a single tree
that consists of a collection of weak learners (shallow trees). It is
powerful because it can control for both bias and variance. Each
addition of a weak learner aims to reduce the bias of the model. The
collection of weak learners has the effect of reducing the variance of
the model. Even though it controls for both, most of the focus is on
bias reduction.If the initial function in the first step of the
algorithm is *f̂*<sub>*x*</sub> , then the initial residuals are the
y-values.When this is the case, the final boosted model will be the
following equation, where $\hat{f\_{b}}(x)$ is the weak-learning
decision tree from each iteration.

$$
\Large \hat{f}(x) = \sum_{b=1}^{B} \lambda \hat{f_{b}}(x)
$$
  
There are three tuning parameters for boosting: B, , and d. The
parameter B represents the number of shallow trees that will be fit to
the residuals. This value should be determined using cross-validation
since a large value may result in over-fitting. The parameter $B$ is
closely tied to the shrinkage parameter . The parameter is called the
shrinkage parameter and this controls the rate at which the model
learns. A small lambda value confers a small adjustment to each
sequential model. If the value of is extremely small, the model will
need a large value for B in order for the data to be fit accurately. The
parameter d defines the number of splits in each of the shallow trees.
When we are referring to these sequentially added shallow trees, we mean
that the value of d is small.

There are several algorithms for implementing boosting. Some example
algorithms are AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost (there are
others). AdaBoost is commonly recognized as the first algorithm that
successfully implemented the boosting algorithm. Gradient Boosting is a
generalization of AdaBoost, and XGBoost is an optimized gradient
boosting algorithm. One problem with boosting is that it can be very
slow, especially for large datasets. This is part of the reason why
XGBoost has become so popular.

### XGBoost

There are many algorithms to implement boosting. The first boosting
algorithm is recognized as AdaBoost and was mostly used for binary
classification. Gradient Boosting is a generalization of AdaBoost and
allows for the use of different loss functions. This improvement meant
that it could be applied to regression and multi-class classification
problems.One issue with Gradient Boosting, which is common among
boosting in general, is that the learning process can be very
slow.XGBoost is an improved implementation of the Gradient Boosting
algorithm optimized for speed and accuracy.It is optimized for speed and
has been observed to be more accurate in many cases, which is how it got
its name: eXtreme Gradient Boosting. The success of XGBoost is
attributed to several key algorithmic improvements:  

1.  Regularized learning objective

2.  Novel tree-based algorithm for handling sparse data

3.  Weighted quantile sketch for learning

4.  Optimized computer hardware utilization

To implement a boosting algorithm, there is a chosen loss function
(usually based on prediction error) that gets minimized. Gradient
Boosting uses gradients to accomplish this. XGBoost improves upon this
process by

  
XGBoost uses regularization of the loss function. Briefly, boosting
works by iteratively adding weak learner shallow trees. This improvement
helps to prevent over fitting by smoothing the solutions of terminal
nodes in the shallow trees that are used for boosting.Regularization
works by adding a penalty to a traditional loss function, usually based
on errors or residuals. Common types of regularization are the l1 and l2
regularization.The loss function used by XGBoost is given below.The
first term is a loss function that measures the difference between the
predicted and actual values of y.The second term is the regularization
term, or penalty, and uses both l1 and l2 regularization.The penalty
works by reducing the complexity of the model.This rationale is
analogous to cost complexity pruning in decision trees.There are
alternative methods for regularization, but this method has been shown
to be easier to implement for parallelization.Note that when the
regularization term is set to zero, the loss function is identical to
traditional gradient boosting.  

$$
\Large L = \sum_{i}l(y_{i'}, \hat{y_{i}}) + \sum_{k}(\gamma T + \frac {1}{2} \lambda ||w||^{2})
$$

The second major improvement on boosting is the use of second-order
derivatives in the optimization of the loss function.The use of
second-derivatives yields more information about how to minimize the
loss function faster.Usually for large datasets, it is not possible to
explore all possible tree structures. Therefore, the use of the second
derivative helps to pick which splits are optimal.The loss function
cannot be optimized using traditional methods.The designers of XGBoost
proposed an additive training strategy that necessitates the use of the
second derivative for large datasets.

A third major feature is shrinkage and feature sub-sampling to prevent
over-fitting.Shrinkage refers to the parameter used in the boosting
algorithm described in the previous section. Feature sub-sampling is a
technique that refers to the construction of the shallow trees during
boosting.When these trees are constructed, at each split, only a
fraction of the total features are considered.Random forests are known
for employing this methodology as it decorrelates successive trees and
allows for different patterns to be captured.

There are several splitting algorithms incorporated into the function
that can be defined by the user.These splitting algorithms are listed
below.

1.  Exact Greedy Algorithm: This algorithm considers all of the possible
    splits for the features and picks a split based on the greatest
    reduction in the loss function.For continuous variables, the
    observations are sorted in ascending order then calculates split
    statistics (such as Sum of Squared Errors)between each
    observation.For n-many observations and m-many features, there are
    (n-1) possible splits per feature and m(n-1) possible splits. For
    large datasets, this is infeasible and requires the use of the
    approximate algorithm.

2.  Approximate Algorithm: This algorithm improves upon the exact greedy
    algorithm and can work with large datasets.Instead of exploring all
    possible splits, the algorithm proposes split points based on
    quantiles and maps continuous features to these “bins”.Split
    statistics are calculated for the bins as a whole and then the split
    point is chosen based on which was best. The quantile strategy is
    distributable and recomputable, meaning it is faster.The designers
    also showed that this approximate quantile strategy can yield
    similar predictive performance as models that use the exact
    strategy. This quantile strategy is called weighted quantile sketch,
    and can be used for weighted data.

3.  Sparsity-Aware Split Finding: Many datasets contain sparse data
    (such as missing data and zero-entries from one-hot encoding or
    other values). By incorporating a pattern recognition algorithm for
    sparse data, the model can run much faster for datasets with lots of
    sparse data.XGBoost assigns a default direction to each node when it
    is sparse.This “unified” approach allows for faster computation
    times.  

The final improvement for XGBoost is the system optimization.Tree
construction and sorting data (during the splitting algorithm) are the
most computationally intensive and time consuming. Large datasets may
not always be able to be modeled on a device. XGBoost was designed to be
able to work efficiently on any device and in parallel with other
devices in a distributed manner.To take the most advantage of a computer
system, large datasets need to first be divided into blocks of data.
XGBoost utilizes the following computational system improvements:

1.  Column Block for Parallel Learning - To reduce the time of sorting,
    data is stored in blocks and only sorted once. The data is stored in
    a compressed column format.

2.  Parallelization - The data blocks are distributed among the CPU
    cores. Therefore, collecting statistics from columns can be done
    using a parallel algorithm for finding splits.

3.  Distributed Computing - Blocking the data allows for it to be
    distributed among different machines or disks. This allows the model
    to work on large datasets.

4.  Cache Awareness - Storing gradient statistics in the cache of a CPU
    is computationally more efficient.

5.  Blocks for Out-of-Core Computation - Dividing the data into blocks
    and using computer science techniques known as block compression and
    sharding allows for the model to work with very large datasets.

In summary, XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that is designed
for speed and scalability.It incorporates many different algorithms that
the user can choose to use depending on their data structure.XGBoost is
commonly used to take advantage of these design features and has been
shown to perform just as well, oftentimes better, than other gradient
boosting algorithms

## Application: Forest Cover Type

Given forestry data from four wilderness areas in Roosevelt National
Forest, classify the patches into one of 7 cover types, listed below:

  
1. Spruce/fir

1.  Lodgepole Pine

2.  Ponderosa Pine

3.  Cottonwood/Willow

4.  Aspen

5.  Douglas/fir

6.  Krummholz

### Data Description

The forest cover type problem requires a prediction of the type of trees
that are growing on a plot of land from a variety of descriptive
features that affect which species are able to grow in those
conditions.An effective model would be able to accurately predict the
cover type, allowing researchers to make these predictions without using
remotely sensed data.There are 12 predictor variables that can be used
to predict the cover type.Table 1 below summarizes each of these
predictors. Each observation in the dataset consists of measurements
from these variables from a 30 meter by 30 meter plot of land in
northern Colorado.There are 581,012 observations in this dataset.The
dataset was released in 1998.

Table 1: Above is a summary of all of the features in the dataset. The
dataset contains a total of 54 features because some of the variables
are one-hot encoded, however, there are only 13 truly unique features.

The data was collected from four different wilderness areas (out of a
total 6 wilderness areas) within the Roosevelt National Forest in
Northern Colorado.The cover type was determined by the US Forest Service
Region 2 Resource Information System data. A wilderness area is an area
that is relatively untouched by humans; this means that any ecological
processes are the result of nature rather than forest management
services. The four wilderness areas studied in Roosevelt National Forest
were Neota, Rawah, Comanche, and Cache la Poudre. These four areas
differ in elevation and geography, even though they are nearby,
resulting in different species of trees covering the land.Neota consists
mostly of spruce/fir.Rawah and Comanche are mostly lodgepole pine, with
a smattering of spruce/fir and aspen. Cache la Poudre consists mostly of
Ponderosa Pine, Douglas/Fir, and Cottonwood/Willow. It should be noted
that approximately 85% of the observations consist of two types of
classes.There are no missing values.

Tables 1-2 and Figure 1 show some frequency distributions of the cover
types and wilderness areas. From these, it can be seen that the dataset
is dominated by the two cover types and two wilderness areas. This is
attributable to the relative sizes of the wilderness areas. It is
important to note the imbalance of observations as this may impact the
bias of the model. The Rawah wilderness area is approximately 119.4 sq.
miles; the Neota wilderness area is approximately 15.5 sq. miles; the
Comanche wilderness area is approximately 104.4 sq. miles; the Cache la
Poudre wilderness area is approximately 14.5 sq. miles. From Figure 1,
there is a significant proportion of the total observations
(approximately 20%) that are in the same soil type and cover type.
Figure 2 displays a matrix of correlation values between all of the
numeric variables. No significant conclusions regarding the relationship
between variables can be concluded. Figure 3 shows that elevation does a
great job distinguishing between the cover types. Other variables were
explored, but there were no significant patterns identified.
